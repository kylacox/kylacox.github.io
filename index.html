            <p>Hi! My Name is Kyla and I am studing graphic design. I love to paint and draw it is one of my favorite pations. 
             My biggest dream is to work as a Disney animator one day and have my art on the big screen. I like to be out doors and explore natur and do different activities.
             I really enjoy just being creative and free to just be myself and explore the depths of the world and its art and technology. 
            </p>
